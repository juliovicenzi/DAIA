# DAIA: Insulin Calculator Chat Model for Diabetes Type 1 Patients

DAIA is an Open Source toy prototype of a chat helper for patients with type 1 diabetes.

A big challange for patients is calculating the amount of insulin to take for a meal (called insulin bolus). Incorrect insulin intake can lead to hyperglycemia: when the blood glucose is above acceptable levels, and the more dangerous hypoglycemia: when the blood glucose is too low. For more information, see [Glycemic Targets: Standards of Medical Care in Diabetes (2021)](https://diabetesjournals.org/care/article/44/Supplement_1/S73/30909/6-Glycemic-Targets-Standards-of-Medical-Care-in) by the American Diabetes Association.

To help with this challange, DAIA uses a chat interface, where the user can report their meal, and using Large Language Model's alongside a [nutrional value database](data/README.md), it outputs the bolus units.
